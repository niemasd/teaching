This page consists of links to books, documentaries, etc. that I personally found helpful in learning about video game history (bold + star indicates that I thought it was especially good).
It is not comprehensive by any means, and if you or anyone you know has additional recommendations, please let me know, and I can add them.
Note that many of the books listed below are available for free as eBooks and audiobooks via [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) through your local public library (e.g. [San Diego County Library](https://www.sdcl.org/faq/libby/)).
