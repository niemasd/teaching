# Custom Comparator
In most programming languages, comparable types (such as numbers and strings) have built-in comparison functions that are used by default when performing tasks that require element comparison, such as sorting. For example, C++ `string` comparison will use [alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order) by default. However, what if I wanted to sort a collection of strings in an ordering that is different than the default, such as in order of increasing length?

In C++, you can define a custom function object that satisfies the requirements of [Compare](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare), also known as a "custom comparator," which defines a custom less-than comparison. You can then call the [`std::sort`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/) function and provide your custom comparator as the third argument (`comp`), and `std::sort` will sort your elements based on your custom comparator.

# Lambda Expressions
As you work on your Suffix Array and Burrows-Wheeler Transform implementations, you may find that you want to define a custom `unsigned int` comparator that relies on a local variable (the `string` object from which you are computing the Suffix Array or Burrows-Wheeler Transform), and you will find that defining a custom comparator *outside* of the function can be problematic with respect to variable scope: if you define the custom comparator *outside* of the function, it will not have access to the local `string` variable.

How can we possibly define a custom comparison function object that is able to access our local `string` variable and any other local variables? One possible solution/hint is to use a [Lambda expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp?view=msvc-170), which is a way of defining an unnamed function object that can capture local variables. In other words, it's essentially an in-line way of defining a function *within* a function. Be sure to read the [Microsoft C++ documentation about Lambda expressions]([https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda#Lambda_capture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp)) as well as the [C++ documentation about `std::sort`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort) (which provides examples that use Lambda expressions) for more details.
