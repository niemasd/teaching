In this Project, you will be implementing a tool to compress and uncompress files using Huffman Coding.

Remember that this is a Project, not a PA, and as such, it is much more involved! To be successful, you **absolutely must** read through the **entire** write-up before even attempting to write a single line of code! Familiarize yourself with the components/sections of the write-up so that, when you finally start coding, you will have a better understanding of what the project entails, and when you inevitably get stuck, you will know where in this write-up to look for tips on how to progress.

# Academic Integrity
This Project must be completed **100% independently!** You may only discuss the Project with the Tutors, TAs, and Instructors. You are free to use resources from the internet, but you are not allowed to blatantly copy-and-paste code. If you ever find yourself highlighting a code snippet, copying, and pasting into your Project, you are likely violating the Academic Integrity Policy. If you have any concerns or doubts regarding what you are about to do, *please* be sure to post on the discussion board first to ask us if it is okay.
